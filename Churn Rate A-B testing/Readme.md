# A/B testing using tableau

### What is A/B testing
When we try and understand a independent feature w.r.t independent variables where the independent variable has only binary or two values that can be called as a A/B testing. This can be said as apart of statistical inference test but cannot be called as a fully functional statistical inference test.

### Example

Here we will try and understand our data set using different visualization which will be further used in Churn Rate logistic regression alogrithm to choose which features to use and not to use in implementation of the algorithm.

Also here we will be using the concept of reference line which is the average churn rate of the total people and understand our data w.r.t to that line.

### Credit Card A/B test

Here in the credit card test we can clearly see that it makes no significant difference which is clearly visible. If have the credit card or if you don't have a credit the churn rate appears to be the same.

### Geographical A/B test

In this chart we can clearly see the churn rate is quite higher in germany signifying there is some problem in germany. The bank services might not be good or customers are not satisfied which can be used for further analysis.

Further analysis can be found in the tableau file shared.
