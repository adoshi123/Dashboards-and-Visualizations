# Understanding UK Jobs using active filters and Calculated fields and Bins

Here is dataset about UK and surrounding countries about their jobs and their savings in the bank by age,gender and Job classification for a bank. 

### Understanding bins
Here age in the data set can be seen at intervals of 1. Creating a headache for a person to understand rather we can combine them in bins of intervals of 5 and use it to understand the data over a large section. This can be done using tableau inbuild CREATA BINS functions.
Here are the images usings Bins and without bins.

### Understanding Calculated fields
Sometime we want to find the highest sales for categories or any specific column. We might have two columns number of units sold and price for each unit. So we may calculate the field using tableau inbuilt function.

### Creating active filters in dashboards
We always need dashboards to be active i.e. if we click all the associated sheets must respond according to it.

Rest of the work can be found in the tableau file.
