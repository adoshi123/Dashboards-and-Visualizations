# Deceptive-Visualization

Introduction:
Data visualization is powerful tool to represent any given data facts with the facts clearly visible, narratives, conveyed through or supported by visualizations. While the use of such visual depictions as persuasion devices is not new, the popular use of visualizations has undoubtedly increased due in part to user-friendly software that allows nonexperts to create visualizations. As such practices become more widespread and accessible, important new challenges and questions arise. If visualizations can make messages more accessible, comprehensible and persuasive, visual representations can also be easily misused and misunderstood - even by their creators. This can be deceiving and can manipulate the minds of the audience watching it.

Original Visualization:

This chart clearly displays that the Gold price and Oil price hand in hand over the years. Further it clearly displays the spike from late 1990’s about prices increasing clearly till 2014 peaking and then decreasing sharply after those years. This clearly supports the claim that gold and oil prices have been in sync majorly over the years.

The critique on this can be that it doesn’t narrow down to the certain years and broadly display and compare the them over the years. It really necessary to understand it for recent times with a more closer look over the years.

Data Wrangling

Narrowed the data to recent year and averaging out it for the whole year instead of breaking it down to month over month.

Deceptive Visualization:

Here the audience can be clearly deceived by giving a look at the years 2011 to 2013 where once increase and once decreases. Further for the year 2014 to 2015 their is huge drop in oil price but not in gold price which decieve them further. Again, for the year 2016 to 2017 Gold price remains stable but then other increase adding further to the deception. Also making it a bar vs line graph makes the differences more visible i.e. Highlighting them. Adding to it more is the claim which says about rising commodity prices but actually never takes in considerations.
