Introduction

The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, 
divided equally between the National Football Conference(NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).
The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, 
and the highest professional level of American football in the world. 
The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, 
with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. 
Following the conclusion of the regular season, 
six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, 
a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which is usually held in the first Sunday in February, 
and is played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.

The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League 
for the 1922 season. The NFL agreed to merge with the American Football League (AFL) in 1966, 
and the first Super Bowl was held at the end of that season; the merger was completed in 1970. 
Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world 
and is the most popular sports league in the United States. 
The Super Bowl is among the biggest club sporting events in the world and individual Super Bowl games account for many of the most 
watched television programs in American history, 
all occupying the Nielsen's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015. 
The NFL's executive officer is the commissioner, who has broad authority in governing the league.
 
Critique on original work

•	The claim is about NFL players arrest rates for crime is less than USA arrest rate. But the as it clearly visible it never compares the USA arrest rates and NFL player arrest rates.
•	This chart also has dumped information about different crimes for each type which is not all needed as per the claim.
•	Further going away from the claim, it describes about team and day wise arrest rates which is not needed to explain the claim.

Redesign Goal

The real aim of redesign project is to make a visualization which can provide a better realistic data displaying the claim and which is more persuasive.

In the last decade, the headlines and coverage generated from stories about NFL player arrests can make it sound like the NFL is full of criminals. The target of the claim is to make people believe that though players are aggressive in their play style which leads them to such behavior off pitch still they rate of arresting NFL players for their crimes is lower than actual arrest rates of USA. The redesigned visualization will support the claim of the original visualization while comparing it to the USA arrest rates for the years 2000-2014.  Also, I have compared data only for violent crimes like Assault, Rape, Murder/ Manslaughter and Theft/Burglary.

Data Wrangling

The data for comparing it to USA arrest rates is directly collected from FBI website where it gives me arrest rates from 2000 to 2014. I had to clean extra data for NFL arrest rates from year 2015 to 2017. Further I deleted unwanted columns like Team name, division, description etc. Adding to that I only kept crimes which were violent according to the FBI i.e. as described above.

Conclusion
The overall arrests rate for NFL players is lower than the USA arrests rate for violent crimes. Although for years 2010 is shows a spike and in 2011 it shows that the arrests rate were high then general population reason being player started getting much more aggressive of the pitch due to intense competition for those years.
This visualization can be further improved with data focusing on a certain age and help us understand better.
