# My first attempt with tableau

Here I am trying to explore tableau and understand how it works. What are dashboards, how do we add a data source, 
what is a story and here is what I come up with

The data is about the leaks happened in different organization, with the method how they were lost.
### Here is how data looks like

This is the cleaned file. I had to do numerous data cleaning commands using pandas to come up with the clean file, which includes deleting of unwanted columns, renaming them, replacing NAN values with usefull values etc.

I tried to look the data from different angles

#### First one being what the major method of leak

#### Second being which type of organization lost what number of records
